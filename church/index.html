                  for the church — and to expose the false traditions that have

                In the Kingdom study, we see how God foretold the coming of the
                church throughout the centuries. Jesus preached for 40 days
                after His resurrection about the coming of the Kingdom of God.

                  The church is the body of Christ. The body needs the head.
                  Christ is the head over the body. Could you separate your head
                  from your body? The church is essential to Christianity! There
                  is no such thing as solo Christians. You have to be connected
                  to the body.

                  We were once strangers to Christ, but now we are members of
                  His household. The church is not merely a meeting — it is a

                  The cornerstone of the church is Christ, and the foundation is
                  made up of the Apostles and Prophets. The Apostles represent
                  the New Testament, and the Prophets represent the Old
                  Testament. Together, they form the biblical foundation of the
                  church.

                  <strong>Romans 6:3-4</strong> &mdash; We are also baptized
                  into Christ Himself. Baptism is the moment we become
                  Christians — sons and daughters of God — and at the same time,
                  members of the church, the family of God.

                  There should be no divisions within the church. Following

              <ul>
                <li>
                  The Bible teaches that there is only one body of Christ.
                  (Romans 12:4-5; 1 Corinthians 12:12-13)
                </li>
                <li>
                  God sees one church — all baptized disciples around the world
                  who are committed to obeying His Word. This is called the
                  "church universal" — the one true church.
                </li>
                <li>
                  A local congregation is called the "visible church." In the
                  first century, all the "visible churches" made up the "church
                  universal." However, because many visible churches today have
                  departed from true doctrine — and because not all sold-out
                  baptized disciples are in the same fellowship — we should
                  strive to be part of a local congregation where everyone is
                  committed to living by God's Word.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The Greek word for "church" is "ekklesia," which means
                  "assembly" or "called out." ("Ek" means "out," and "kaleo"
                  means "to call.") To be a disciple is to be called out from
                  the world. Therefore, the church in the Bible was the assembly
                  of the called out.
