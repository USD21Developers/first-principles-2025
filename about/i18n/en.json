  "p1": "This study series presents a Biblical approach to guide those who are open to discovering the joy of a lasting relationship with the Lord. It is designed to include the essential Biblical doctrines that help in making committed disciples of Jesus Christ. While the Bible cannot be compromised, this series can be adapted to help individuals from different religious, ethnic, or personal backgrounds become true Christians. It is our prayer that this series will be an effective tool for transforming hearts and lives by equipping disciples to \"love God and love people.\" May God use this humble effort to inspire more souls to proclaim that \"Jesus is Lord\" as we evangelize the nations in this generation!",
