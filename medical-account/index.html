                  <strong>Dr. C. Truman Davis</strong><br />
                  A Physician Analyzes the Crucifixion<br />
                  by Dr. C. Truman Davis
                </p>

                <p>
                  About a decade ago, reading Jim Bishop's The Day Christ Died,
                  I realized that I had for years taken the Crucifixion more or
                  less for granted — that I had grown callous to its horror by a
                  too easy familiarity with the grim details and a too distant
                  friendship with our Lord. It finally occurred to me that,
                  though a physician, I didn't even know the actual immediate
                  cause of death. The Gospel writers don't help us much on this
                  point, because crucifixion and scourging were so common during
                  their lifetime that they apparently considered a detailed
                  description unnecessary. So we have only the concise words of
                  the Evangelists: "Pilate, having scourged Jesus, delivered Him
                  to them to be crucified — and they crucified Him."
                </p>

                <p>
                  I have no competence to discuss the infinite psychic and
                  spiritual suffering of the Incarnate God atoning for the sins
                  of fallen man. But it seemed to me that as a physician I might
                  pursue the physiological and anatomical aspects of our Lord's
                  passion at some detail. What did the body of Jesus of Nazareth
                  actually endure during those hours of torture?
                </p>

                <p>
                  This led me first to a study of the practice of crucifixion
                  itself; that is, torture and execution by fixation to a cross.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Apparently, the first known practice of crucifixion was by the
                  Persians. Alexander and his generals brought it back to the
                  Mediterranean world — to Egypt and to Carthage. The Romans
                  apparently learned the practice from the Carthaginians and (as
                  with almost everything the Romans did) rapidly developed a
                  very high degree of efficiency and skill at it. A number of
                  Roman authors (Livy, Cicero, Tacitus) comment on crucifixion,
                  and several innovations, modifications, and variations are
                  described in the ancient literature.
                </p>

                <p>
                  For instance, the upright portion of the cross (or stipes)
                  could have the cross-arm (or patibulum) attached two or three
                  feet below its top in what we commonly think of as the Latin
                  cross. The most common form used in our Lord's day, however,
                  was the Tau cross, shaped like our T. In this cross the
                  patibulum was placed in a notch at the top of the stipes.
                  There is archeological evidence that it was on this type of
                  cross that Jesus was crucified.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Without any historical or biblical proof, Medieval and
                  Renaissance painters have given us our picture of Christ
                  carrying the entire cross. But the upright post, or stipes,
                  was generally fixed permanently in the ground at the site of
                  execution and the condemned man was forced to carry the
                  patibulum, weighing about 110 pounds, from the prison to the
                  place of execution.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Many of the painters and most of the sculptors of crucifixion,
                  also show the nails through the palms. Historical Roman
                  accounts and experimental work have established that the nails
                  were driven between the small bones of the wrists (radial and
                  ulna) and not through the palms. Nails driven through the
                  palms will strip out between the fingers when made to support
                  the weight of the human body. The misconception may have come
                  about through a misunderstanding of Jesus' words to Thomas,
                  "Observe my hands." Anatomists, both modern and ancient, have
                  always considered the wrist as part of the hand.
                </p>

                <p>
                  A titulus, or small sign, stating the victim's crime was
                  usually placed on a staff, carried at the front of the
                  procession from the prison, and later nailed to the cross so
                  that it extended above the head. This sign with its staff
                  nailed to the top of the cross would have given it somewhat
                  the characteristic form of the Latin cross.
                </p>

                <p>
                  But, of course, the physical passion of the Christ began in
                  Gethsemane. Of the many aspects of this initial suffering, the
                  one of greatest physiological interest is the bloody sweat. It
                  is interesting that St. Luke, the physician, is the only one
                  to mention this. He says, "And being in Agony, He prayed the
                  longer. And His sweat became as drops of blood, trickling down
                  upon the ground."
                </p>

                <p>
                  Every ruse (trick) imaginable has been used by modern scholars
                  to explain away this description, apparently under the
                  mistaken impression that this just doesn't happen. A great
                  deal of effort could have been saved had the doubters
                  consulted the medical literature. Though very rare, the
                  phenomenon of Hematidrosis, or bloody sweat, is well
                  documented. Under great emotional stress of the kind our Lord
                  suffered, tiny capillaries in the sweat glands can break, thus
                  mixing blood with sweat. This process might well have produced
                  marked weakness and possible shock.
                </p>

                <p></p>
                After the arrest in the middle of the night, Jesus was next
                brought before the Sanhedrin and Caiphus, the High Priest; it is
                here that the first physical trauma was inflicted. A soldier
                struck Jesus across the face for remaining silent when
                questioned by Caiphus. The palace guards then blind-folded Him
                and mockingly taunted Him to identify them as they each passed
                by, spat upon Him, and struck Him in the face.

                <p>
                  In the early morning, battered and bruised, dehydrated, and
                  exhausted from a sleepless night, Jesus is taken across the
                  Praetorium of the Fortress Antonia, the seat of government of
                  the Procurator of Judea, Pontius Pilate. You are, of course,
                  familiar with Pilate's action in attempting to pass
                  responsibility to Herod Antipas, the Tetrarch of Judea. Jesus
                  apparently suffered no physical mistreatment at the hands of
                  Herod and was returned to Pilate. It was the, in response to
                  the cries of the mob, that Pilate ordered Bar-Abbas released
                  and condemned Jesus to scourging and crucifixion.
                </p>

                <p>
                  There is much disagreement among authorities about the unusual
                  scourging as a prelude to crucifixion. Most Roman writers from
                  this period do not associate the two. Many scholars believe
                  that Pilate originally ordered Jesus scourged as his full
                  punishment and that the death sentence by crucifixion came
                  only in response to the taunt by the mob that the Procurator
                  was not properly defending Caesar against this pretender who
                  allegedly claimed to be the King of the Jews.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Preparations for the scourging were carried out when the
                  Prisoner was stripped of His clothing and His hands tied to a
                  post above His head. It is doubtful the Romans would have made
                  any attempt to follow the Jewish law in this matter, but the
                  Jews had an ancient law prohibiting more than forty lashes.
                </p>

                <p>
                  The Roman legionnaire steps forward with the flagrum (or
                  flagellum) in his hand. This is a short whip consisting of
                  several heavy, leather thongs with two small balls of lead
                  attached near the ends of each. The heavy whip is brought down
                  with full force again and again across Jesus' shoulders, back,
                  and legs. At first the thongs cut through the skin only. Then,
                  as the blows continue, they cut deeper into the subcutaneous
                  tissues, producing first an oozing of blood from the
                  capillaries and veins of the skin, and finally spurting
                  arterial bleeding from vessels in the underlying muscles.
                </p>

                <p>
                  The small balls of lead first produce large, deep bruises
                  which are broken open by subsequent blows. Finally the skin of
                  the back is hanging in long ribbons and the entire area is an
                  unrecognizable mass of torn, bleeding tissue. When it is
                  determined by the centurion in charge that the prisoner is
                  near death, the beating is finally stopped.
                </p>

                <p>
                  The half-fainting Jesus is then untied and allowed to slump to
                  the stone pavement, wet with His own blood. The Roman soldiers
                  see a great joke in this provincial Jew claiming to be king.
                  They throw a robe across His shoulders and place a stick in
                  His hand for a scepter. They still need a crown to make their
                  travesty complete. Flexible branches covered with long thorns
                  (commonly used in bundles for firewood) are plaited into the
                  shape of a crown and this is pressed into His scalp. Again
                  there is copious bleeding, the scalp being one of the most
                  vascular areas of the body.
                </p>

                <p>
                  After mocking Him and striking Him across the face, the
                  soldiers take the stick from His hand and strike Him across
                  the head, driving the thorns deeper into His scalp. Finally,
                  they tire of their sadistic sport and the robe is torn from
                  His back. Already having adhered to the clots of blood and
                  serum in the wounds, its removal causes excruciating pain just
                  as in the careless removal of a surgical bandage, and almost
                  as though He were again being whipped the wounds once more
                  begin to bleed.
                </p>

                <p>
                  In deference to Jewish custom, the Romans return His garments.
                  The heavy patibulum of the cross is tied across His shoulders,
                  and the procession of the condemned Christ, two thieves, and
                  the execution detail of Roman soldiers headed by a centurion
                  begins its slow journey along the Via Dolorosa. In spite of
                  His efforts to walk erect, the weight of the heavy wooden
                  beam, together with the shock produced by copious blood loss,
                  is too much. He stumbles and falls. The rough wood of the beam
                  gouges into the lacerated skin and muscles of the shoulders.
                  He tries to rise, but human muscles have been pushed beyond
                  their endurance.
                </p>

                <p>
                  The centurion, anxious to get on with the crucifixion, selects
                  a stalwart North African onlooker, Simon of Cyrene, to carry
                  the cross. Jesus follows, still bleeding and sweating the
                  cold, clammy sweat of shock, until the 650 yard journey from
                  the fortress Antonia to Golgotha is finally completed.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Jesus is offered wine mixed with myrrh, a mild analgesic
                  mixture. He refuses to drink. Simon is ordered to place the
                  patibulum on the ground and Jesus quickly thrown backward with
                  His shoulders against the wood. The legionnaire feels for the
                  depression at the front of the wrist. He drives a heavy,
                  square, wrought-iron nail through the wrist and deep into the
                  wood. Quickly, he moves to the other side and repeats the
                  action being careful not to pull the arms to tightly, but to
                  allow some flexion and movement. The patibulum is then lifted
                  in place at the top of the stipes and the titulus reading
                  "Jesus of Nazareth, King of the Jews" is nailed in place.
                </p>

                <p>
                  The left foot is now pressed backward against the right foot,
                  and with both feet extended, toes down, a nail is driven
                  through the arch of each, leaving the knees moderately flexed.
                  The Victim is now crucified. As He slowly sags down with more
                  weight on the nails in the wrists excruciating pain shoots
                  along the fingers and up the arms to explode in the brain —
                  the nails in the writs are putting pressure on the median
                  nerves. As He pushes Himself upward to avoid this stretching
                  torment, He places His full weight on the nail through His
                  feet. Again there is the searing agony of the nail tearing
                  through the nerves between the metatarsal bones of the feet.
                </p>

                <p>
                  At this point, as the arms fatigue, great waves of cramps
                  sweep over the muscles, knotting them in deep, relentless,
                  throbbing pain. With these cramps comes the inability to push
                  Himself upward. Hanging by his arms, the pectoral muscles are
                  paralyzed and the intercostal muscles are unable to act. Air
                  can be drawn into the lungs, but cannot be exhaled. Jesus
                  fights to raise Himself in order to get even one short breath.
                  Finally, carbon dioxide builds up in the lungs and in the
                  blood stream and the cramps partially subside. Spasmodically,
                  he is able to push Himself upward to exhale and bring in the
                  life-giving oxygen. It was undoubtedly during these periods
                  that He uttered the seven short sentences recorded:
                </p>

                <p>
                  The first, looking down at the Roman soldiers throwing dice
                  for His seamless garment, "Father, forgive them for they know
                  not what they do."
                </p>

                <p>
                  The second, to the penitent thief, "Today thou shalt be with
                  me in Paradise."
                </p>

                <p>
                  The third, looking down at the terrified, grief-stricken
                  adolescent John — the beloved Apostle — he said, "Behold thy
                  mother." Then, looking to His mother Mary, "Woman behold thy
                  son."
                </p>

                <p>
                  The fourth cry is from the beginning of the 22nd Psalm, "My
                  God, my God, why has thou forsaken me?"
                </p>

                <p>
                  Hours of limitless pain, cycles of twisting, joint-rending
                  cramps, intermittent partial asphyxiation, searing pain where
                  tissue is torn from His lacerated back as He moves up and down
                  against the rough timber. Then another agony begins...A
                  terrible crushing pain deep in the chest as the pericardium
                  slowly fills with serum and begins to compress the heart.
                </p>

                <p>
                  One remembers again the 22nd Psalm, the 14th verse: "I am
                  poured out like water, and all my bones are out of joint; my
                  heart is like wax; it is melted in the midst of my bowels."
                </p>

                <p>
                  It is now almost over. The loss of tissue fluids has reached a
                  critical level; the compressed heart is struggling to pump
                  heavy, thick, sluggish blood into the tissue; the tortured
                  lungs are making a frantic effort to gasp in small gulps of
                  air. The markedly dehydrated tissues send their flood of
                  stimuli to the brain.
                </p>

                <p>Jesus gasps His fifth cry, "I thirst."</p>

                <p>
                  One remembers another verse from the prophetic 22nd Psalm: "My
                  strength is dried up like a potsherd; and my tongue cleaveth
                  to my jaws; and thou has brought me into the dust of death."
                </p>

                <p>
                  A sponge soaked in posca, the cheap, sour wine which is the
                  staple drink of the Roman legionaries, is lifted to His lips.
                  He apparently doesn't take any of the liquid. The body of
                  Jesus is now in extremes, and He can feel the chill of death
                  creeping through His tissues. This realization brings out His
                  sixth words, possibly little more than a tortured whisper, "It
                  is finished." His mission of atonement has completed. Finally
                  He can allow his body to die.
                </p>

                <p>
                  With one last surge of strength, he once again presses His
                  torn feet against the nail, straightens His legs, takes a
                  deeper breath, and utters His seventh and last cry, "Father!
                  Into thy hands I commit my spirit."
                </p>

                <p>
                  The rest you know. In order that the Sabbath not be profaned,
                  the Jews asked that the condemned men be dispatched and
                  removed from the crosses. The common method of ending a
                  crucifixion was by crucifracture, the breaking of the bones of
                  the legs. This prevented the victim from pushing himself
                  upward; thus the tension could not be relieved from the
                  muscles of the chest and rapid suffocation occurred. The legs
                  of the two thieves were broken, but when the soldiers came to
                  Jesus they saw that this was unnecessary.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Apparently to make doubly sure of death, the legionnaire drove
                  his lance through the fifth interspace between the ribs,
                  upward through the pericardium and into the heart. The 34th
                  verse of the 19th chapter of the Gospel according to St. John
                  reports: "And immediately there came out blood and water."
                  That is, there was an escape of water fluid from the sac
                  surrounding the heart, giving postmortem evidence that Our
                  Lord died not the usual crucifixion death by suffocation, but
                  of heart failure due to shock and constriction of the heart by
                  fluid in the pericardium.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Thus we have had our glimpse — including the medical evidence
                  — of that epitome of evil which man has exhibited toward Man
                  and toward God. It has been a terrible sight, and more than
                  enough to leave us despondent and depressed. How grateful we
                  can be that we have the great sequel in the infinite mercy of
                  God toward man — at once the miracle of the atonement and the
                  expectation of the triumphant Easter morning.
