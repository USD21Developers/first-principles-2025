                  Purpose: To help you decide to make the Bible your standard
                  for life and to build a conviction about what the Bible says
                  about itself.
                </strong>
                Q: What is your viewpoint of the Bible? Do you believe it is the
                divine Word of God? Talk about the validity of the Bible.

                <h2>FACTS ABOUT THE BIBLE:</h2>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    40 authors of 66 different books within the Bible; written
                    in three languages &mdash; Hebrew, Aramaic, and Greek;
                    written on three continents &mdash; Africa, Asia, and
                    Europe.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Approximately 400 prophecies regarding Jesus in the Old
                    Testament fulfilled in the New Testament &mdash; over a
                    1,500-year period of writing.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Not one archaeological find has ever contradicted the Bible.
                    Many have supported it.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Over 40,000 ancient copies of the Bible &mdash; more than
                    any other ancient manuscript.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Scientific evidence from the Bible: Isaiah 40:22 &mdash; the
                    Earth is a sphere; Isaiah 55:10- 11 &mdash; the water cycle;
                    Job 26:7 &mdash; the free float of Earth in space.
                  </li>
                </ul>

                <p class="ms-3">
                  Q: If I were to ask you to determine how long my Bible was (in
                  inches or centimeters), how long would you say it is? How
                  would you know for sure? You would need a standard of
                  measurement &mdash; like a ruler. Anything else would just be
                  a guess.

                  <li>
                    The Word of God is not dead. It is relevant today because it
                    exposes the human heart, which has not changed.

                  <li>
                    The Bible is a double-edged sword. It cuts sin out of us,
                    although it may hurt. It cuts through the layers of our
                    heart to expose the truth, just like a scalpel cutting out
                    cancer.

                  <li>
                    The Bible is meant to be read and applied, not changed to
                    suit our opinions. (Example: A doctor gives a prescription,
                    but a pharmacist decides to change it.)

                  <li>
                    It's not about who is right but what is right. It is the
                    Word that determines how a church should be.

                    Individual emotions and rationalizing the Bible can pull you
                    away from the truth. (Example: Getting pulled over for
                    speeding but not “feeling” like you were doesn't make you

                    The Jewish tradition of Corban: At 30 years old, a Jew

                    also provide for his parents. The tradition of Corban gave
                    money to the synagogue instead of providing for their
                    parents, thus dishonoring them.
