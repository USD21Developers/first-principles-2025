                    Why does God go through all this trouble? So that people may

                    In this passage, God shares His vision for His people, who
                    were in physical captivity to their oppressors. In the same
                    way, we can be held captive to sin in our lives, and God
                    wants to set us free from spiritual slavery!
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    God wants us to give us hope and future, but to discover
                    these plans, we must first draw near to Him. The only way to
                    do that is to seek Him with all our hearts.

                    A case study of someone seeking God. Are you seeking God

                    Ethiopian eunuch? Three important character traits of the

                  <li>
                    Sacrifice: He traveled 1500 miles from Ethiopia to Jerusalem
                    to seek God.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Humility: Although he was an important and religious man, he
                    humbly listened to someone capable of teaching him the
                    Scriptures.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Obedience: He responded immediately, saying, "Why shouldn't
                    I be baptized?"
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    He rejoiced after his baptism because he now had a
                    relationship with God!
