                  Purpose: To hate sin & love God because we appreciate Jesus'
                  sacrifice.
                </strong>
                Q: How would you define sacrifice? Who would you die for? The
                Cross is the foundation of Christianity. Sin hurts both God and
                us. Jesus was fully God and fully human. He experienced the same
                feelings and emotions we do.

                  Jesus stops Peter from defending Him. He could have called 12
                  legions to save Him, but He did not. (One legion was
                  approximately 5,000 Roman soldiers. Twelve legions would be
                  approximately 60,000 angels!)

                  He was broken at a "heart level" and even wept bitterly,

                <li>
                  He became the first leader of the first-century church in Acts

                  The sin of indecision (omission) &mdash; Pilate's indecision
                  was a decision. He cared more about people's opinions than
                  God's opinions. He was man-focused, not God-focused.

                  Jesus was crucified at 9 AM (Mark 15:25) and remained on the

                  eternity, Jesus felt that separation.
